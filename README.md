## Introduction

We were tasked by the school to showcase what we've learned over the past 2 years as students at Noroff. This exam is to show the students general developer skills, as well as technical and visual skills.

### Objectives

- Demonstrate front-end development skills using React.
- Optimize build and development workflows with Vite.
- Create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces with Tailwind CSS.

### Technologies Used

- **Vite**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**

### Design Differences

The final design of the project differs slightly from the initial prototype due to the following factors:

- User Feedback: Insights from potential users during development led to design refinements to enhance usability and overall experience.
- Enhanced Functionality: Modifications were made to improve the application's functionality and user flow, resulting in slight deviations from the original design.
